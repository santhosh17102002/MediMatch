            <h2>HOW COLDOVER ORAL DROPS WORKS</h2>
            <br>
            <p>COLDOVER ORAL DROPS relieves cold symptoms where phenylephrine decreases nasal congestion by acting on α1-adrenergic receptors in the small vessels of the nasal mucosa to produce constriction, resulting in decreased swelling and increased drainage of the sinus cavities and chlorpheniramine binds to the histamine H1 receptor and blocks its action, resulting in temporary relief of the negative symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, watery and itchy eyes) brought on by histamine.</p>
