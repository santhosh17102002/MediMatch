                NAM COLD FX TABLET is a combination of Fexofenadine, Paracetamol and Phenylephrine which belongs to the group of medicines called Antihistamines, Analgesics and Antipyretics and Nasal decongestants. It is used to treat Rhinopharyngitis (inflammation of nasal and pharyngeal mucosa. Symptoms include runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, fever and sore throat), Rhinitis (inflammation of nasal mucosa. Symptoms include sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, watery eyes, itching of the nose or throat) with deviated nasal symptoms and Tonsillitis (inflammation of tonsils causing fever, sore throat, difficulty in swallowing and painful lymph nodes in neck).
                
                Fexofenadine is an Antihistamine and blocks the binding of histamine (responsible for allergic reactions such as nasal congestion, runny nose) to Histamine H1receptors, thus preventing allergic reactions while  Paracetamol is an Analgesics and Antipyretics acts mainly in the brain by increasing the pain threshold by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes which are involved in prostaglandins production (responsible for pain) and also acts on the heat-regulating centres of the hypothalamus resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating and loss of body heat. Thus, decreasing pain and fever and Phenylephrine is a Nasal decongestant works by acting on alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the arterioles of the nasal mucosa to produce constriction, this leads to decreased oedema and increased drainage of the sinus cavities, thus relieves nasal congestion.
