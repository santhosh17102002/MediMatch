            <h2>HOW COLDOVER P ORANGE FLAVOUR SUSPENSION WORKS</h2>
            <br>
            <p>COLDOVER P ORANGE FLAVOUR SUSPENSION relieves upper respiratory symptoms where Chlorpheniramine binds to the histamine H1 receptor and blocks its action, resulting in temporary relief of the negative symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, watery and itchy eyes) brought on by histamine. Paracetamol relieves pain by elevation of the pain threshold and reduces fever by acting on the on the heat-regulating centre in your brain. Phenylephrine constricts blood vessels and reduces the blood flow to certain areas, thus decreasing swelling and allowing nasal and respiratory passages to open up.</p>
