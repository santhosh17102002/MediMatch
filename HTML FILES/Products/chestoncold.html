            <h2>HOW CHESTON COLD TABLET WORKS</h2>
            <br>
            <p>CHESTON COLD TABLET is a combination of Cetirizine, Paracetamol and Phenylephrine where Cetirizine is an H1 receptor antagonist that works by blocking the action of a chemical messenger (histamine) responsible for runny nose, watery eyes, and sneezing. Paracetamol is an analgesic and antipyretic that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins (chemicals that cause inflammation, pain, and fever) which helps in reducing pain and fever. Phenylephrine is a nasal decongestant that acts by narrowing the small blood vessels providing temporary relief from congestion or stuffiness in the nose.</p>
